Skills
------
* Learn how to use tools like gdb (GNU Debugger).
* Extract instructions from memory.
* Learn about simple cyber attacks.


Solution notes
--------------
The solutions depend intimately on the decisions the compiler makes
about memory layout, not all of which are standardized. We compiled
our solutions with clang version 3.8.0-2ubuntu4 on an x86-64 Linux
machine.
